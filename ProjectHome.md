Thought I would check out the Scala Language, no better way than making a game.

Two thumbs up for Scala.  The language itself is very intuitive and fun to write.  It has all the bells and whistles you would want in a language, and still feels consistent.  My one complaint so far is the verbosity of Arrays -- which seem counter the rest of the language.

I used the Eclipse plugin, which gets two thumbs down.  Intellisense works when it wants to, no "Quick Fix", no refactoring support which is disabling.  With that said, Scala's light syntax helped with these short comings of the IDE.
